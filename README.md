myChatApplication is a project developed for my masters thesis and it is a kind of social media for the students of different departments and faculty.
The idea of this project is to provide a kind of hang out for students where they can rub mind and focus on something difeerent. It also allow students to tell which department is doing good or which department and lecturer they like most.

A said it is just a kind of social networking for students where students can say anything both academical and social. Any topic is welcome.
